		<h4>Stay at home unless you have to go to work.</h4>
		<h4>Talk to your employer about working at home if possible.</h4>
		<h4>Avoid all non-essential trips in your community.</h4>
		<h4>Do not gather in groups.</h4>	
		<h4>Limit contact with people at higher risk, such as older adults and those in poor health.</h4>
		<h4>Go outside to exercise but stay close to home.</h4>
		<h4>If you leave your home, always keep a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others.</h4>
		<h4>Household contacts (people you live with) do not need to distance from each other unless they are sick or have travelled in the last 14 days.</h4>
